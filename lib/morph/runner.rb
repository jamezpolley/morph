Scraper didn't create an SQLite database in your current working directory called
data.sqlite. If you've just created your first scraper and not edited the code yet
this is to be expected.

To fix this make your scraper write to an SQLite database at data.sqlite.

However, this could also be related to an intermittent problem which we're
working hard to resolve: https://github.com/openaustralia/morph/issues/1064
